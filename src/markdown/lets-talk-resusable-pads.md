In an effort to reduce my waste and live more sustainably, I purchased a pack of reusable pads. I’ve seen women talk about their experiences with menstrual cups, reusable pads, and period panties and I decided to try out the reusable pads. I purchased mine from Amazon from a brand called Teamoy, and it came in a pack of 6. The pads itself are so pretty and feel amazing! I have some thoughts and opinions based on my experience using it for the first time, and here they are:

What I liked:
The pad is made from 4 layers of antibacterial bamboo fibre and is super soft and extremely comfortable! I loved that there was no chaffing as there sometimes is with the single-use pad.
I purchased the longest pad from the range, so there is a lower chance of getting messed, especially at night. I like that the pad has buttons on the wings so you can securely clip it closed.
Sustainability- I love the idea of reducing my personal waste and not contributing to the landfills by using a reusable pad.
What I didn't like:
The long size does not fit well in regular underwear. I feel it would be best using a “granny” panty, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing because most of us do have specific period underwear, but it is still worth noting. I tried it in regular-sized underwear and the pad was too big for it.
Once your pad is full, you’re supposed to run it under cold water until the water runs clear. This takes forever! This means so much water is being wasted. Once you’re done rinsing it, you can toss it into the washing machine. Now, whilst I love the fact that the pad is reusable, I am not too happy about how much water is wasted in the cleaning process.
Will I still use reusable pads? Definitely. Personally, I will use them once my heaviest days are over- I feel that they would work best towards the end of my period. Will I only use reusable pads? Unfortunately, no. I don’t see myself using them when I am out and about. I think they are best suited for when you’re home, and can obviously rinse them out immediately. Every small step counts when it comes to our impact on the environment, so I think this is a great way to reduce waste and use something more sustainable where possible. If you’ve used reusable pads or plan on trying it out, feel free to share your experience with me over on Instagram. :)
