One of my biggest regrets with my skin growing up is that I did not use SPF religiously. Over the last 5 years, I’ve come to understand how important SPF is, as well as the importance of regular re-application throughout the day. I have tried and tested many sunscreens, and as a brown-skinned girl, I am often frustrated that many, if not most sunscreens always leave a white cast or an oily film on the skin. With mineral sunscreen, however, it is extremely difficult to find an SPF that does not leave a heavy white cast and when I get into the SPF’s I use below, you will see that I do prefer a mineral sunscreen over a chemical one. With content creators and YouTubers starting and engaging in conversations about representation, I’ve definitely noticed that there are more options available for POC than before. I’ve managed to come across a couple of sunscreens that work great for my skin tone. The ones below are my favourites.



The INKEY LIST SPF 30 Sunscreen (mineral sunscreen)

Mineral sunscreen is arguably better for the skin than chemical sunscreen. With mineral sunscreen, the ingredients aren’t absorbed into your skin like they are with chemical sunscreen, rather it sits on top of your skin and deflects UV radiation off your skin. I have been using this SPF from the INKEY LIST for over a month and it does not leave a white cast. I reapply when I need to and it also sits really well under my makeup. I love this SPF so much!

Shiseido Clear Stick UV Protector SPF 50

I’ve talked about this SPF on my Instagram before, and it is one of the best sunscreens to use over makeup when you need to reapply throughout the day. The stick is clear, so there is no white cast or film. It is so easy to use and blends into the skin very easily. Even though the product is so small, the stick lasts really long. It is the ideal size to pop into your handbag and touch up as you go.

REN Clean Screen Mineral SPF 30 (mineral sunscreen)

This SPF is the latest to my collection. It is the only one from my list that does have a white cast when you first apply it, but as you work it into your skin, it does disappear. I do think, however, that if you have a deep skin tone, this one may not work too well. This SPF is a mattifying one which I love because it does not look greasy and if applying makeup it also works well as a primer.
